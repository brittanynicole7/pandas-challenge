# Pandas Homework

# Overview
For this activity, we were asked to create a high level overview of school and student performances within a district. Specifically, we were asked to create an overarching district summary and a school summary as well as filter these dataframes by different metrics (i.e., percent passing, school spenind, school size, and school type). We were also asked to create a report highlighting our findings from these analyses. 

# Results 
For the current project, I accomplished the following deliverables with the help of the starter code provided:
- Merged two datasets
- Created a summary statistics table for the district including number of schoools, students, budget, average math and reading scores, percent passing math, reaading, and both. 
- Created a DataFrame at the school level that provided the school type, total students, total school budget, budget per student, average math and reading scores, and percent passing math, reading, and both. 
- Filtered the highest and lowest performing schools based on overall percent passing(i.e., the percent of those passing both math and reading).
- Calculated and created a DataFrame for average math and reading scores by grade per school. 
- Created a summary table calculating average math and readng scores and percent passing math, reading, and both based on total budget per student. 
- Created a summary table calculating average math and readng scores and percent passing math, reading, and both based on school size. 
- Created a summary table calculating average math and readng scores and percent passing math, reading, and both based on school type. 
- I also included a written report that summarizes the analyses conducted and draws conclusions from the analyses.
